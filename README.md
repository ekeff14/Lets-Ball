# Lets-Ball

Lets Ball is a child friendly educational gaming website aimed for children still developing their alphabetic and numeric skills.

Please note: The website is hosted with a local server called Xampp, to test with full functionality you must download and install Xampp and activate the Apache and MySQL modules in the Xampp control panel.
Link to download Xampp version 8.2.12 / PHP 8.2.12: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

Steps by step guide:

1. Download and Install Xampp from the installer provided in the repository.
2. Clone the repository to the htdocs folder in the Xampp main folder.
3. Open the Xampp control panel and start the Apache and MySQL modules, you can close the control panel after starting the 2 modules.
4. Then open a browser and type (http://localhost/Lets-Ball/Lets-Ball/pages/login.php) this is assuming you cloned the repository directly to the htdocs file, if not the link will be from the first folder the repository is placed inside the htdocs folder, till the login.php file in the pages folder of the repository. E.g for me it is (http://localhost/Lets-Ball-Repo/Lets-Ball/Lets-Ball/pages/login.php) when my login.php file exists in (C:\xampp\htdocs\Lets-Ball-Repo\Lets-Ball\Lets-Ball\Pages).
5. At this stage you have now accessed the login file and should click the signup link to make a new account and explore the website.

Lastly please note that this website is still under further development and undergoes regular maintenance so remember to git pull regularly.
